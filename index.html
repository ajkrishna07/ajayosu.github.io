          I also currently serve as the Communications Officer for OSU's <a href="https://www.aigsa.club" target="_blank">AI Graduate Student Association</a> where I help spread the word about the social and professional events we organize for our AI community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I earned a Masters in Computer Science from Oregon State University under the advisement of <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~chenliz/" target="_blank">Dr. Lizhong Chen</a>.

          Perceptions of the built environment, such as nature quality, beauty, relaxation, and safety, may be key factors linking the built environment to human health. For quantitative research, an exposure measure must be reproducible, accurate, and precise -- here we work to develop such measures for perceptions of the urban environment. We created crowd-sourced and image-based deep learning methods that were able to measure and model these perceptions. A transfer learning approach was used to train deep learning models by leveraging existing image perception data from the PlacePulse 2.0 dataset, which includes 1.1 million image comparisons, and refining based on our new Washington State Twin Registry (WSTR) perception data collected using a crowdsourcing effort on Amazon Mechanical Turk where participants compared two street-view images and quantified perceptions of nature quality, beauty, relaxation, and safety. We optimized street-view image sampling methods to improve the quality and resulting perception data specific to participants enrolled in the WSTR health study. Resulting models were applied to the WSTR addresses to estimate exposures and evaluate associations with traditional built environment measures.

However, few studies have examined these types of perceptions due to the difficulty in quantifying them objectively in large populations.

          Advances in deep learning based image processing techniques have led to their adoption for a wide range of applications, and in tow with these developments is a dramatic increase in the availability of high quality datasets. With this comes the need to accelerate and scale deep learning applications in order to keep up with the size of data and best use available hardware resources. In this paper, we propose a useful scheme to enable accelerated and distributed deployment of PSPNet inferences, which allows scaling across disparate compute clusters with recourse for system instability and heterogeneity of resources. The systemic incorporation of multiprocessing paradigms and pipelining also allows the scheme to mitigate the time penalties of multiscale inference and significantly improves total inference times when used on extremely large datasets. The use of this distributed scheme to process close to 150,000 Google Street View images as part of a public health study has demonstrated excellent promise in addressing issues of deployment, maintenance, crash recovery, and dataset management at scale.
